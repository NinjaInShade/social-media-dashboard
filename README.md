## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid & autofit/minmax
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I would say I learned how to effectively put together a full theme switching system. Organising CSS colour variables, changing the theme via and button, saving theme to local storage & using the users OS theme preference.

A more comprehensive overview of this process and struggles I faced, see this project I did a couple days before this:
